# Android Example Series:  Recycler Views

The goal of this project is to present various types of Recycler Views in a manner where if you understand one, that it would be easy to transition to another.

So, simply choose a branch you're interested/comfortable in and do `git diff your_branch..other_branch` study the deltas : )

Aiming for the `master` branch to be the vanilla branch -- from which you can tell how to start from scratch

## Where to begin
Start at the `master' and do some diffs, and contribute : D

## Necessary git commands

### to get a particular branch to your local machine

`git pull origin <branch_name>`

example:

`git pull origin recycler-view-simple`

### to compare branches just type:

`git diff <branch_one>..<branch_two>`

example:

`git diff master..recycler-view-simple`

### to move to a different branch (once downloaded on your local machine)

`git checkout <branch_name>`
